    <p>Conventional methods of learning have always been a hassle.<br> Millions of children keep getting subjected to the same studying envirnonments, and the need of any singular kid is side-lined.<br> Thus, to remedy this, we bring modern technology into the mix. <br> Over the years, and especially since the 1980s, there is prominence and speedy development in the world of AI.</p>
