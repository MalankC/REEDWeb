# REEDWeb

REEDWeb is an introductory website that will guide our prospective future users to the who's, what's and why's to our new era-defining product: **REED**.

**REED** aims to be an AI-enabled assistant and an integrated process into your child's progress in today's competitive educational atmosphere.

This idea was collectively developed by me and my team members for Internal Ideathon, 2023 for CodeChef, VIT, Vellore.
